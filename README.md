# AMATH_351
 Python code used for instruction of AMATH 351 (Intro to DIffEqs) at the University of Washington. 
 
 The folder titled `hw_plots` contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) intended to help students plot solutions for various homework assignments. These are meant for students who have had minimal or no experience with numerical plotting of functions (e.g., NumPy/PyPlot, MATLAB, etc.).
 
 The folder titled `phase_plane` contains the files (Jupyter notebooks, one helper `.py` file) used for a demonstration on numerical construction of phase portraits for 2D autonomous systems. In this folder, the file `pplane_demo.ipynb` provides the template for the live demo (to be filled in during class), and the file `pplane_demo_complete.ipynb` contains the full version of the demo (i.e., what you would fill the template file in with). This demo uses the toggle switch system as a motivating example. The file `pplane.ipynb` demonstrates a version of the demo code written for any 2D autonomous system (examples include toggle switch with different parameter values and Lotka-Volterra system), the main code for which is contained in the file `pplane.py.`
